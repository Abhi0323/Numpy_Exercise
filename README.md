# Numpy_Exercise

Introduction:
As a programmer, I possess a vast array of skills that allow me to create and manipulate arrays, perform vectorized operations, use broadcasting, perform indexing and slicing, perform linear algebraic operations, generate random numbers, perform masking and filtering, and conduct Fourier transforms. In this read me, I will showcase my skills by explaining the code I have written in a clear and impressive way.

Array Creation and Manipulation:
The first step in programming is creating and manipulating arrays. I have written a code in Python that demonstrates how to create a 2D array, specify the data type, reshape an array, flatten an array, and concatenate arrays. In addition, I have used the NumPy library to carry out these operations, which highlights my familiarity with this essential tool.

Vectorized Operations:
I am well-versed in vectorized operations, which allow me to perform element-wise additions, multiplications, and apply functions to an array. The code I have written showcases how to add two arrays element-wise, multiply two arrays element-wise, and apply a function to an array.

Broadcasting:
Broadcasting is another skill I have mastered. In my code, I have demonstrated how to broadcast a scalar to an array and how to broadcast an array to another array.

Indexing and Slicing:
As a programmer, I know how to access and extract data from arrays using indexing and slicing techniques. The code I have written showcases how to index an array, slice an array, index a 2D array, and slice a 2D array.

Linear Algebra:
I possess extensive knowledge in linear algebra, which is essential in programming. The code I have written demonstrates how to perform matrix multiplication and matrix decomposition.

Random Number Generation:
Generating random numbers is a crucial skill in programming. In my code, I have showcased how to generate random numbers from a uniform distribution and a normal distribution.

Masking and Filtering:
Masking and filtering are important techniques in programming that allow for the extraction of specific elements from an array. The code I have written demonstrates how to create a boolean mask and filter out elements less than 50 from a random 2D array.

Fourier Transforms:
Lastly, I have demonstrated my proficiency in conducting Fourier transforms in my code. The code showcases how to define a signal, compute the Fourier transform of the signal, compute the frequencies corresponding to each Fourier coefficient, and plot the signal and its Fourier transform.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the code I have written demonstrates my skills in creating and manipulating arrays, performing vectorized operations, using broadcasting, performing indexing and slicing, performing linear algebraic operations, generating random numbers, performing masking and filtering, and conducting Fourier transforms. My proficiency in these areas highlights my expertise in programming and my ability to solve complex problems.
